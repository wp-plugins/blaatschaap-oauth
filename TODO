TODO::: 20141127


*  Rewrite button generation code, such that an Auth service returns an
array with buttons. Buttons should contain an order parameter to determine
the displayed order.

      Login/register sorted, however LINK is a problem. Separation code not
      implemented yet. OAUTH specific code in bsauth.php !!!
      Needs to be extracted to blaatoauth.php such that the code becomes 
      service independant.

*  What else is required to support multiple auth providers? Is it possible to
generate separation code?

* Sync Library / check for hard coded services

* Add some more icons per default

* Hide "Default logo" if none present

* Can we integrate the BS logo in there?

* Update documentation on website

* Bigger rewrite required? More Object Oriented?
