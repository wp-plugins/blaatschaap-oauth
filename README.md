BlaatSchaap Coding Projects WordPress Plugin for OAuth Authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This projects uses the OAuth library by Manuel Lemos to interact 
with OAuth providers. 

The project is work in progress. Authentication works, but some
work needs to be done in the configuration pages. 

Known Issues:
Authentication to VK.com does not work. This must be investigated.
Configure a known-to-work service through the "Custom Service" 
option, to verify the problem is not in the way Custom Services
are handled by the plugin code. Otherwise this is an incompatibility
between OAuth implementations.
