Scope:

FaceBook doesn't login when the scope is missing, but allows this to be
an empty string. 

Google gives an error message about the scope missing when it is said to
a random string. When set to a string like "email", it shows the dialig
just fine, but it does not return an access token.

When setting the scope to 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email'
we retrieve a token from Google as well. 

Therefore, we must store them somewhere. Perhaps we should add them to
the class, or store them in the database
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo
