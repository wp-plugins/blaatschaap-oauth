This plugin allows your users to sign in with any OAuth provider. 
There are many pre-configured sites such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. 

== Description ==

Please note: tested with 3.7 and 3.8. It will probably work with earlier 
versions but this has not been tested.

The OAuth plugin for WordPress allows you to provide authentication against any 
OAuth provider. This plugin is uses the OAuth library by Manuel Lemos. The 
plugin allows the admin to select any from the services supported 
out-of-the-box by the said library. Additionally it is possible to configure a 
service manually, which means almost any site supporting the OAuth protocol can 
be used.  


== Installation ==

Plugins are usually installed through the WordPress admin panel, which is 
an automated process. If manual installation is desired, extract the archive 
and upload the files and directories to
/path/to/your/webroot/wp-content/plugins/

0.2 :

Bugfix: BlaatSchaap Plugins Overview page was missing, and displayed an
        error message when trying to access it.

Synchronised with the OAuth library. The library uses an external
configuration file now. This configuration file is parsed and all
new services are listed.
