===

This plugin turns your WordPress website into an OAuth Consumer.
It allowsallows your users to sign in with any OAuth provider.
This plugin comes with many pre-configured sites such as Facebook, 
Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Tumblr and many others. It
is possible to configure any OAuth Provider with this plugin.

== Description ==

First tested with WordPress version 3.7. It will probably work with earlier
versions but this has not been tested.

The OAuth plugin for WordPress allows you to provide authentication against any
OAuth provider. This plugin is uses the OAuth library by Manuel Lemos. The
plugin allows the admin to select any from the services supported
out-of-the-box by the said library. Additionally it is possible to configure a
service manually, which means any site supporting the OAuth protocol can
be used.


== Installation ==

Plugins are usually installed through the WordPress admin panel, which is
an automated process. If manual installation is desired, extract the archive
and upload the files and directories to
/path/to/your/webroot/wp-content/plugins/

== Changelog ==
